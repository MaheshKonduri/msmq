# jMSMQClient
This is a MSMQ client in Java supporting transactional and non-transactional types, you can run it under 32bit JRE in either 32bit or 64bit operation system, altertively you can compile the native part into 64bit to adopt to 64bit JRE. Any questions please contact me, I will try my best to provide help.

Please be advised that it's someone else initializing the code base than me, I found it and made additional changes, otherwise please let me know if you are the original author.
