# jMSMQClient
This is a MSMQ client in Java supporting transactional and non-transactional types. Any questions please contact me, I will try my best to provide help.
Please be advised that it's someone else initializing the code base than me, I found it and made additional changes, otherwise please let me know if you are the original author.
